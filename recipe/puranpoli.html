         <ul>
             <li>1 cup blanched chana dal</li>
             <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
             <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds powder</li>
             <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
             <li>salt as required</li>
             <li>1/2 teaspoon refined oil</li>
             <li>1 cup powdered jaggery</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon powdered green cardamom</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg powder</li>
             <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
             <li>1/4 cup water</li>
         </ul>
     <h3>Procedure for Cooking</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Put a saucepan over medium flame and add ghee to it. Once the ghee is melted, add blanched dal in it. Roast for 2-3 minutes
                 and then add jaggery, ginger powder, cardamom powder, fennel powder and nutmeg powder into it. Mix all the ingredients and
                  cook the dal for another 2-3 minutes. Once done, turn off the flame and let it cool. Then mash the dal using a masher.</li>
             <li>In a dough kneading plate, add all-purpose flour, turmeric, salt to taste and refined oil. Mix well and then add a little
                 water at a time and knead to make a stiff dough. Divide the dough into 3 parts and keep it aside.</li>
             <li>Take one part and press it a little to make space in the centre. Once done, take the chana-jaggery mixture and fill it in
                 the centre. Close and shape again like a ball. Grease your hands a little and make roti with your hands. You can roll it
                  out using a rolling pin too.</li>
             <li>Put a tawa on medium flame and place the roti on it. Add 1/2 teaspoon ghee and cook well from both sides. Serve hot or pair
                 with tea or coffee.</li>
