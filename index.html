    <p>Welcome to the First Project of the Foundation Course. In this project we will see some reciepies of <em>Indian Cuisine.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Indian cuisine</strong> , the foods and methods of their preparation traditional to India. India does not have a single cuisine. Due to its 
       wide variety of climates, soil types, cultures, and religions, as well as influences from other countries, India has a diverse range
       of cuisines. As a whole, Indian cuisine can be dated to the prehistoric period and can be found across the world wherever there is a
       significant Indian diaspora. Indian cuisine has also played a key role in global history, Indian spices being a goal of the 
       European Age of Discovery.</p>
